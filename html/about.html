      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Since our modest beginnings in 2016, Amr restuarant's development has
        been enlivened with the energy to cook and serve solid, Egyptian-roused
        takeout food.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast to other Egyptian eateries, Amr restaurant was made with the
        explicit expectation to appear as something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        We realize numerous individuals love Egyptian sustenance, yet a large
        number of them loathe or are unconscious of the regularly unfortunate
        fixings that make run-of-the-mill Egyptian nourishment taste so great.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our menu highlights things that utilization the sound and fragrant
        flavors, however, forgets the stuffing ghee, spread, oil, and
        overwhelming cream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our expectation is that youâ€™ll join the developing pattern that such a
        large number of others have officially found and you will attempt Amr
        restaurant as a remarkable option to other Egyptian eateries as well as
        to all other solid sustenance alternatives out there!
